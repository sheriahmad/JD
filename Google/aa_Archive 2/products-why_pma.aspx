					<h2>Why Go PMA?</h2>
					<p>Every year, more businesses discover the advantage of buying FAA-PMA parts.  As a result, the aerospace industry has witnessed a continuous rise in the usage of PMA parts on a national, as well as global, scope.</p>
					<p>The benefits gained from buying PMA parts through Jet Parts Engineering are two-fold.  First, we try to keep all of our parts in-stock so that the parts you need will ship within twenty-four hours.  In contrast, the lead time for most OEM parts are anywhere between two to twelve weeks.  Second, an FAA-PMA part costs approximately two-thirds the cost of its OEM counterpart.  Thus, not only are you receiving the parts you need at an immediate turn-around, you are saving money and putting your business dollars to better work.</p>
					<p>Ultimately, a successful business cannot be enticed by lead-time and price alone.  The product, in and of itself, must be exceptional.  Consequently, the rise in PMA usage can be attributed to one, bottom line:</p>
					<p><strong class="achtung">FAA-PMA parts are equal, if not superior, to their OEM counterparts.</strong></p>
					<p>We at Jet Parts Engineering, Inc. stand behind that statement at every juncture, from the conception of a project, to our rigorous testing standards and practices, to the moment your order arrives at your facility.  Our reverse-engineering process is meticulous in order to ensure that our parts meet the strictest FAA standards.  Jet Parts Engineering, Inc. endorses every product we make.  We hire only the most qualified engineers and technicians.  In addition, our support team is unbeatable in its knowledge, accessibility and service support.</p>
					<p>We are confident that buying PMA will benefit every aspect of your business.  As an experienced leader in the PMA industry, Jet Parts Engineering is committed to doing business with efficiency and integrity.  Discover what others already know, and let us make a PMA believer out of you.</p>

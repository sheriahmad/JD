    <Title>March 2013 – JPE Employees Participate in 2013 “The Big Climb” Fundraising Event</Title>
    <StoryBody>On March 24, Jet Parts Engineering employees participated in “The Big Climb”, a physically challenging fundraiser, to help raise money for blood cancer research by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS). The LLS has been funded since 1954 and has awarded more than $600 million for research specifically targeting leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. The Big Climb event takes place in downtown Seattle at the Columbia Center and sells out every year with 6,000 people participating. The climb itself is 69 flights of stairs, of which participants can choose to enter as a timed competitive racer or walk as a climber at their own pace.  People all around the Seattle area support of this cause and JPE shares in that passion. In 2013, JPE had the largest employee turn out to date and were able to contribute over $1,000 to the cause. &lt;a href="http://www.bigclimb.org/"&gt;Click here for more information about the Big Climb Seattle&lt;/a&gt;.</StoryBody>

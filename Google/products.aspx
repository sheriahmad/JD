        Why Go PMA?</h3>
    <p class="pageBody">
        <img src="images/jpe_px4.png" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="20" alt="" />Every
        year, more businesses discover the advantage of buying FAA-PMA parts. As a result,
        the aerospace industry has witnessed a continuous rise in the usage of PMA parts
        on a global scale.</p>
    <p class="pageBody">
        The benefits gained from buying PMA parts through Jet Parts Engineering are two-fold.
        First, we keep almost all of our parts in stock so the parts you need will ship
        within twenty-four hours. In contrast, the lead time for most OEM parts are anywhere
        between two to twelve weeks. Second, an FAA-PMA part costs approximately two-thirds
        the price of its OEM counterpart. Not only do you receive the parts you need with
        an immediate turn-around, you are also saving money and putting your business dollars
        to better work.
    </p>
    <p class="pageBody">
        Ultimately however, a successful business cannot be enticed by lead-time and price
        alone. The product, in and of itself, must be exceptional. Consequently, the rise
        in PMA usage can be attributed to one bottom line:

    <h3 class="pageHeadlinesH3">
        FAA-PMA parts are equal, if not superior, to their OEM counterparts.</h3>
    <p class="pageBody">
        We stand behind that statement at every juncture, from the conception of a project,
        to our rigorous testing standards and practices, to the moment your order arrives

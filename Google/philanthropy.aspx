            At Jet Parts Engineering we believe a successful company must do its part to give
            back to the community. JPE is proud to join forces with charitable organizations,
            such as Water 1st and the Ronald McDonald House Charity, in an effort to better
            the world around us.

            For 3 years in a row, Jet Parts Engineering employees have made the <a href="http://www.llswa.org/site/PageNavigator/SeattleBigClimb/Home.html"> Big Climb</a> to raise money 
            for the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society (LLS). In support of the LLS mission: To cure Leukemia,

            families.

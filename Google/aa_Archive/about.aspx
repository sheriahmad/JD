<p class="pageBodyPar1">Jet Parts Engineering, Inc. is an engineering-intensive company that manufactures and sells FAA approved PMA parts. Our PMAs go through an intensive approval process with the FAA to ensure that they are equal to or better in design than their OEM counterparts. We understand how important it is to offer the safest and most reliable parts to our customers, and we are able to offer them at a price dramatically lower than the OEMs.</p>

<p class="pageBody">Our ability to deliver premier PMA parts comes from a highly focused approach we have developed that allows us to design, produce, inspect, and ship parts in an efficient, effective, and timely manner. We try to keep all of our parts in stock, and in doing so, we offer greatly reduced lead times.</p>
